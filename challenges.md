Intergrating Ubeswap sdk 
1. configuring the sdk to work with the ussd apllication is quite hard since there is no such application that is available 
2. understanding Ubeswap and how it works was hard at the start since there where multple routers inovled to make the swapping functionality work.
3. we encontered mutiple errors like  
    a. `invalid BigNumber value`
    b. Unable To Approve Transaction on the ussd platoform was a big challenge unlike the normal way used in defi paltforms
